# Algorithms

## Repo for collaborative learning of algorithms

## Context

The end goal of all this repo is to give a comprehensive "0 - to entry level job interview candidate level" understanding of how algorithms work and how interviewees can best prepare. All content in here is adapted from a few major sources:

1. CLRS
2. Leetcode (public problems)
3. Project Euler (first 100 problems)
4. Guide to Competitive Programming
5. CSES

## Language Choice

When I started programming, my first language was C++. Then Java. Then Python. After I started working professionally, I had to learn some Javascript/Typescript and now as an engineer at Microsoft my life is almost completely C#. It's common advice but it's worth saying again, learn 1 language well. And then apply that language to everything else. The language I know the best is C# after working on [CLR Via C#](https://github.com/microsoft/Flash_University/tree/main/CLR_via_CSharp) notes for work. I don't think it matters what you pick but pick it and stick with it. 

Solutions can be in any language. I suggest python simply because it is the simplest language (at least according to me) for converting pseudo code into runnable code.
