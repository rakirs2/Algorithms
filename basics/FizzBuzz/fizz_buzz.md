# Fizz Buzz

This is one of the most common problems in all coding screens. It's basically the "do you know how to code" question.

Fundamentally, we're going to iterate from 1 -> n and print fizz for every multiple of 3, buzz for every multiple of 5 and fizz buzz for every multiple of 15 instead of the number.

So if we input 16, you should get

```
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
16
```
Homework is to put a PR in any language into this folder. I'll try running and checking them but it's on you to get it to work.
